This repository contains the slides for the talk given at PyCon 2014:

"Bleeding Edge Packages: for users and developers alike." 


see the slides [here](http://slideviewer.herokuapp.com/github/b-e-p/pycon2014/blob/master/pycon2014_presentation.ipynb)

(and not sure what's going on exactly, but the slides seem to render differently than how they looked when I presented them at pycon; nonetheless, the content is the same.)
